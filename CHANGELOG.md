# Changelog

## 20260912

- Added a read-only `PICO-PAIR` USB disk with an offline browser pairing UI.
- Added a Web Serial control protocol for connection status and pairing codes.
- Added confirmed replacement pairing that forgets the current keyboard and
  scans for a new BLE HID device.
- USB re-enumeration now occurs only when the replacement keyboard's HID report
  descriptor differs from the active descriptor.

## 20260813

- Changes in `hog_host_demo.c`
  - Fixed an issue where the BLE connection state and LED indication would mismatch when the BLE device was rapidly power-cycled.
  - Reordered function definitions to improve source code readability.

- Global Changes (All source files)
  - Code cleanup: Removed modification history comments such as `@add`, `@chg`, and `@del`.

## 20260810

### Added

- Pico 2 W (RP2350) support alongside the Pico W. `PICO_BOARD` picks the target
  and defaults to `pico2_w`.
- `ENABLE_USB_LOGGING`, `ENABLE_HEARTBEAT_LOGS` and `UART_BAUD_RATE` build
  options.

### Fixed

- Keyboards that place a descriptor after the CCC descriptor no longer stall in
  GATT discovery, via BTstack's `ENABLE_GATT_LEGACY_CCC_DISCOVERY`.
- The HID report descriptor cache grew from 500 bytes to 2 KB, so descriptors
  from keyboards with media keys or multi-device switching are not truncated.
- Core 0 no longer touches the CYW43-attached status LED before Core 1 has
  finished `cyw43_arch_init()`, which could hang Core 0 during boot.
- A 12.5-15 ms connection interval is requested once the link is encrypted,
  instead of accepting the device's power-saving default.
